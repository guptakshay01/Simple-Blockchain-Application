# Sample-Blockchain-Application
Created a simple blockchain application using Javascript.
Used crypto-js library of Javascript to implement SHA256.

Following functionalities are implemented:
  1. Creating a blockchain in the form of array.
  2. Creating new block which will have index of block(optional), timestamp, data, hash of previous block.
  3. Validating the blockchain whether it is altered or unaltered.

Use "node main.js" on CMD to run the file from current directory.
