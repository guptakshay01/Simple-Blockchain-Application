# Simple-Blockchain-Application
Created a simple blockchain application using Javascript.
Used crypto-js library of Javascript to implement SHA256.

About Applicatio:
- Implemented Blockchain using JavaScript to demonstrate and learn how Blockchain works
- Utilized crypto-js a JavaScript library to implement SHA256 for generating hash code for each block
- Implemented validation mechanism to check if the block is altered or not
- Performed testing on Node.js a runtime environment for JavaScript

Following functionalities are implemented:
  1. Creating a blockchain in the form of array.
  2. Creating new block which will have index of block(optional), timestamp, data, hash of previous block.
  3. Validating the blockchain whether it is altered or unaltered.

Use "node main.js" on CMD to run the file from current directory.
